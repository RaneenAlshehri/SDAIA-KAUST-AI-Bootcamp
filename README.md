# SDAIA-KAUST-AI-Bootcamp
This is the capstone competition for the KAUST Introduction to ML and DL. In this competition, you will be asked to build an image classifier to classify handwritten Arabic language characters

## Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset

The dataset is composed of 16,800 characters written by 60 participants, the age range is between 19 to 40 years, and 90% of participants are right-hand. Each participant wrote each character (from ’alef’ to ’yeh’) ten times on two forms. The forms were scanned at the resolution of 300 dpi. The dataset is partitioned into two sets: a training set (13,440 characters to 480 images per class) and a test set (3,360 characters to 120 images per class). Writers of training set and test set are exclusive. Ordering of including writers to test set are randomized to make sure that writers of test set were not from a single institution (to ensure variability of the test set).

The dataset was originally compiled by the following authors.
